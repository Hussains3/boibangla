        <p>
            As you place the order, we will make the arrangements for shipping the products to you. The schedules of
            shipping are previously. At the same time, we are liable for any delays in the procedure of shipment. The risk
            of loss and damage is passed to you as soon as the product is delivered to you. We cannot arrange for reverse
            shipment because of the unavailability of our logistic partners. In such a case, we might request you to send
            the products through any kinds of courier services.
