    <h2>Is it safe to use my credit card?</h2>
    <p>Yes, shopping at boibangla.com is 100% safe. Credit card payments are processed through the Atom payment
        gateway. Internet Banking and other payments are processed by Atom. We are also adding other payment gateways
        like PayPal which are the most secured gateways globally. It encrypts your credit card number so that it cannot
        be read as the information travels over the Internet. Furthermore, Atom also asks you to enter the CVV (Credit
        Verification Value) number on your credit card. This is a 3 digit number which follows your credit card number
        and is given at the back of the card to ensure that the person entering the card number has the physical plastic
        card with him/her. You can be assured that Bookswago.com offers you the highest standards of security currently
        available on the Net so as to ensure that your shopping experience is private, safe and secure.</p>
    <h2>Does boibangla.com store my credit card information?</h2>
    <p>boibangla.com does not collect or store your credit card/bank account information at all. Atom authorizes the
        transaction directly without any information passing through us. </p>
