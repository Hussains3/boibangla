            <h2>Discount Conditions</h2>
            <p>
                Boibangla.com.bd always wants to give you your desired books in the best possible market
                price. We always have different offers and discounts running on to make our customers
                happy and make them able to buy more and more books from Boibangla. But sometimes in
                some cases we can not afford to give you proper discounts. Though we try our best to keep
                the price lesser for our beloved customers but sometimes we just can't. We can not give
                discounts for the foreign books because their publishers don't allow us to give any discounts
                at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also can not give discounts in those books which are published by Bangla Academy and
                Islami Foundation Bangladesh. Text books are another category where we can offer very
                little discount. But we can offer discounts in most of our categories and customers can buy
                wide range of books from there. Lastly, Buying and reading books is a passion, it has
                nothing to do with the money. Keep buying and keep reading. Boibangla is always there for
                you.
